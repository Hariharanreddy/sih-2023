# Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, also known as the Clean India Mission, is a nationwide cleanliness campaign launched by the Indian government with the aim of making India clean and free from open defecation. The campaign was officially launched on October 2, 2014, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary.

Some of the objectives of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan include:

1. **Open Defecation Free (ODF) India:** One of the primary goals of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is to achieve an Open Defecation Free (ODF) India. The campaign emphasizes the construction of toilets and the promotion of proper sanitation practices to eliminate the practice of open defecation.

2. **Construction of Toilets:** The mission focuses on building individual and community toilets in rural and urban areas to provide access to proper sanitation facilities. The government has undertaken various initiatives and financial schemes to support the construction of toilets, particularly in rural households.

3. **Behavior Change:** Swachh Bharat Abhiyan aims to bring about a behavioral change among the people regarding sanitation and hygiene practices. It includes awareness campaigns to educate communities about the importance of using toilets, maintaining personal hygiene, and keeping the surroundings clean.

4. **Solid Waste Management:** The campaign addresses the issue of solid waste management by promoting proper waste disposal practices. It encourages the segregation of waste at the source and the establishment of waste management systems at the community level.

5. **Promotion of Cleanliness:** Swachh Bharat Abhiyan promotes cleanliness in public spaces, including streets, markets, and tourist destinations. It encourages citizens to actively participate in cleanliness drives and take responsibility for keeping their surroundings clean.

6. **Rural and Urban Focus:** The mission has both rural and urban components, recognizing that sanitation challenges exist in various settings. In rural areas, the emphasis is on building toilets and ensuring proper sanitation practices, while in urban areas, the focus is on waste management and cleanliness.

7. **Incentives and Recognition:** The government has introduced incentive-based approaches to encourage states, districts, and individuals to actively participate in the campaign. Recognition is given to villages, towns, and cities that achieve ODF status and demonstrate effective sanitation practices.

8. **Technology Integration:** Swachh Bharat Abhiyan leverages technology for monitoring and evaluation. The Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) app allows citizens to report cleanliness-related issues, and real-time data is used to track the progress of the campaign.

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has gained significant momentum and has been one of the flagship programs of the Indian government. It involves the active participation of government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), corporate entities, and citizens in working towards a cleaner and more hygienic India. The mission is aligned with the broader goal of achieving sustainable development and improving the overall quality of life for the people of India.

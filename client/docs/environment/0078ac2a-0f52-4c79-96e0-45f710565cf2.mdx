# COP21 Paris Agreement
The COP21 Paris Agreement is a landmark international accord adopted in December 2015 during the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Paris. The agreement represents a global effort to address climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Key components and goals of the Paris Agreement include:

1. **Limiting Global Warming:** The central aim of the Paris Agreement is to limit the increase in global average temperature and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This more ambitious target recognizes the severe impacts of climate change and the need for stronger mitigation efforts.

2. **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs):** Each participating country is required to submit its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), outlining its climate action plans, commitments, and targets. These contributions are intended to reflect the country's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

3. **Global Stocktake:** The agreement establishes a mechanism for a global stocktake every five years to assess collective progress toward the goals of the agreement. This process involves reviewing countries' NDCs and considering whether they collectively lead to the achievement of the long-term temperature goal.

4. **Adaptation and Resilience:** The Paris Agreement recognizes the importance of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience, and reducing vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. It calls for increased support for adaptation efforts, particularly in developing countries.

5. **Climate Finance:** Developed countries are expected to provide financial support to developing countries to assist them in both mitigation and adaptation efforts. The goal is to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020, with a commitment to further financial support beyond that period.

6. **Technology Transfer and Capacity Building:** The agreement emphasizes the need for technology transfer and capacity building to help developing countries adopt and implement sustainable practices. This includes sharing technology, knowledge, and skills to enhance their ability to address climate change.

7. **Transparency Framework:** The Paris Agreement establishes a transparency framework to promote openness and accountability. Participating countries are required to regularly report on their emissions, progress toward NDCs, and other relevant information.

8. **Loss and Damage:** The agreement recognizes the concept of loss and damage associated with the impacts of climate change, particularly in vulnerable and developing countries. It establishes a mechanism to address issues related to loss and damage.

The Paris Agreement marked a significant shift in the global approach to climate change, as it brought together nearly all countries in a common effort to combat climate change and its impacts. It represents a commitment to a more sustainable and resilient future for the planet. Countries have continued to engage in subsequent COP meetings to refine and enhance their climate commitments and actions.

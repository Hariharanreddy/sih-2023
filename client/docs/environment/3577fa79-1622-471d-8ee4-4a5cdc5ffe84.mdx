# The International Solar Alliance
The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is an intergovernmental organization that aims to promote solar energy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. It was launched on November 30, 2015, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and then-French President Fran√ßois Hollande on the sidelines of the 21st session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris. The ISA was conceived as a coalition of solar-rich countries to address their energy needs and promote sustainable development.

Key features and objectives of the International Solar Alliance include:

1. **Promotion of Solar Energy:** The primary goal of the ISA is to promote the use of solar energy and increase solar capacity in member countries. It focuses on harnessing solar power as a clean and sustainable energy source to meet the growing energy demands of its member nations.

2. **Collaboration and Cooperation:** The ISA facilitates collaboration and cooperation among solar resource-rich countries to share knowledge, best practices, and technology related to solar energy. The alliance provides a platform for member countries to work together on joint projects, research, and capacity-building initiatives.

3. **Scaling Up Solar Investments:** One of the key objectives is to mobilize large-scale investments in solar projects. By aggregating the demand for solar technologies and promoting economies of scale, the ISA aims to make solar power more affordable and accessible for its member countries.

4. **Capacity Building:** The ISA focuses on building the capacity of its member nations in solar energy technologies, policy development, and project implementation. This includes training programs, workshops, and knowledge-sharing activities to enhance the skills and expertise of stakeholders in the solar sector.

5. **Facilitating Policy and Regulatory Support:** The alliance works towards creating an enabling environment for the growth of solar energy by assisting member countries in developing supportive policies and regulations. This involves addressing barriers and challenges related to solar deployment.

6. **International Cooperation:** While the ISA primarily focuses on cooperation among solar-rich countries, it also encourages collaboration with other international organizations, governments, and private sector entities to achieve its objectives. This broader collaboration aims to accelerate the global transition to clean and renewable energy.

7. **Common Risk Mitigation Mechanism (CRMM):** The ISA has introduced the CRMM to address the risks associated with solar projects, particularly in developing countries. This mechanism aims to facilitate the flow of affordable finance to solar projects by reducing perceived risks for investors.

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, the ISA had over 120 member countries, demonstrating a significant global interest in advancing solar energy. Member countries include those located between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, as they receive abundant sunlight throughout the year.

It's important to note that developments and activities related to the International Solar Alliance may have occurred since my last update, and for the latest information, you may want to check official sources or news updates.

# Board Composition
The term "broad composition" in governance typically refers to the inclusive and diverse representation of individuals within the governing bodies or decision-making structures of an organization. It emphasizes the importance of having a wide range of perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds among the individuals who make key decisions within an entity. Broad composition is often seen as a best practice in corporate governance and is considered essential for effective decision-making and ensuring that the interests of various stakeholders are taken into account.

Here are some key aspects of broad composition in governance:

**Diversity of Backgrounds and Experiences:**

**Rationale:** This diversity can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of different aspects of the business, leading to well-informed and robust decision-making.

**Inclusive Representation:**

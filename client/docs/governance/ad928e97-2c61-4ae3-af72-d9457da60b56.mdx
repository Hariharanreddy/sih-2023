# National Corporate Governance Policy

Corporate governance in India is primarily governed by the Companies Act, 2013, along with the rules and regulations prescribed by regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). SEBI, in particular, plays a significant role in regulating corporate governance practices for listed companies.

The Companies Act, 2013, contains provisions related to board composition, audit committees, financial disclosures, shareholder rights, and other aspects of corporate governance. SEBI has also issued the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, which include requirements for corporate governance practices for listed entities.

It's possible that discussions or proposals related to a "National Corporate Governance Policy" have taken place, or new developments have occurred since my last update. If there have been any changes or introductions of such policies, it would be advisable to check the latest official sources, such as the Ministry of Corporate Affairs or SEBI, for the most recent and accurate information.

Corporate governance remains an important aspect of the regulatory landscape in India, and any policy initiatives in this regard would likely aim to strengthen governance practices, enhance transparency, and ensure accountability in corporate decision-making.
